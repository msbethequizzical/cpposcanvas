# cpposcanvas
cppos made using JS(maybe React sooner or later) with the canvas element.

This is a passion project, so it will be free to copy, distribute to friends(r.i.p me)and modify the source code.
BUT, you cannot sell it off for paid money, as it is listed in the GNU GPL(root directory) This project may run off donations sooner or later, so if you want, well then you can.
I will set up a PayPal soon, so donors will be held off for maybe the next week after creation.
So, hope you like this, I needed to figure out how to emulate a computer first then write the OS itself.
